This Java program creates a login screen GUI using Swing, defining a class LoginScreen and initializing it with fonts and labels. The initializer method sets the window's title, size, maximum size, and location. The JLabels and JTextFields are customized, added to a JPanel with a GridLayout, and the window is set to be visible.

# About
This Java program creates a basic login screen GUI using Swing, defining a class LoginScreen that extends JFrame. It initializes the window with the title, size, maximum size, and location, and creates JLabels and JTextFields for "Welcome," "Username," and "Password" with custom fonts. The components are added to a JPanel with a GridLayout, added to the JFrame, and an ImageIcon is set as the window icon. The window is then set to be visible.

# Features

The Java program for creating a basic login screen GUI using Swing includes a LoginScreen Class class, Window Initialization, Component Creation, JLabels for prompts, JTextFields for input fields, Custom Fonts, and Component Layout. The JPanel is a panel with a GridLayout, and the JPanel is added to the JFrame for display. The window's icon is an 'ImageIcon', and the window is visible to the user.

The `LoginScreen` class is well-structured and functional for displaying a basic login screen. Its code organization and readability are 8/10, with meaningful variable names like `WelcomeMessage`, `UsernameTXT`, and `PasswordTXT`. However, more descriptive names for methods could improve readability. The class provides a basic login screen with fields for username and password input, setting appropriate fonts and sizes for the components. However, it lacks functionality for actual login verification. Adding action listeners to handle login attempts and validation would make it more complete.
Error handling is good, with minimal opportunities for runtime errors. Implementing error handling for potential exceptions, such as file loading errors for the icon image, would improve the robustness of the application. The code seems efficient in terms of resource usage and rendering, with no noticeable performance bottlenecks. However, loading the icon image directly from the file system might cause issues if the file path is incorrect or the image is missing.
In summary, the `LoginScreen` class serves its purpose effectively as a basic login UI component in a Java Swing application. Further development to incorporate login functionality and error handling could make it a valuable part of a larger application.
